## Description



We have created a weather website using React which manages a map of locations in a list 
with the option of selecting a specific location in the list and uploading the weather forecast .

We can:

1. Manage map locations in the list.
2. Select a specific location in this list and load the weather forecast using the website https://www.7timer.info


We have created a form  so the user can enter a location (name, latitude, longitude) 
and click a button to add the location to the list that will appear on the page. 
The list can be empty at first. 
The user could also remove a location from the list by the remove button next to each item.



There is a table of the API that displays verbatim (or alternatively by icon) the values of the weather.
The program does not allow duplicates in the list, ie an existing position by name.
List placement should be allowed by a button next to each item in the list.

The program checks that the input is correct and if not, a clear error message should be displayed (what is the problem). It is mandatory to enter a name for the location. Other values ​​must be valid numbers for example, 32, -32,32.12345, in the correct range:
Latitude: [-90.90].


Longitude: [-180,180]
